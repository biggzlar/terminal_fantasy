## core
gameplay-narrative lead by core elements to convey aspects of posthumanism. these aspects are not thought as thorough interpretations but as ideas that are up to the interpretation of the player.
* fuse with the ooze (phyrexian living metal)
* continuous existence as software - leave brain behind
* cyborg transform - stay with the brain
* play as a human (only)
* considering mixtures...

elements can be thought of as the readiness to distance oneself from the original human existence. staying entirely human, improving the human body, leaving the human body but keeping the self to even the entire renunciation of one's own self. thus, the game's premise is to discuss chances and dangers of humankinds evolution in a techonology driven future.
